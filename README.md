## Motivation

### Personal

I have been interested in photography since 2012 and, like every other photographer out there, have always wondered what makes a good picture? I got very lucky that the [best picture](https://unsplash.com/photos/WrPmNpKQUUY) I have taken and posted just happens to be my most popular photo amongst the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) community. But what exactly are the elements of a picture that make it universally well-received despite it being an very subjective because, well, it's a form of art. 

### Question

With many variables such as [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(visual_arts)), [subject](https://www.creativelive.com/photography-guides/photography-subjects), [post-processing](https://improvephotography.com/31639/post-processing-photography/), among many other variables, you can see it becomes increasingly difficult to create the 'perfect' photo. But **what if** we could narrow down the variables to produce a picture in which it illicits a response from a viewer in the form of a download, like, or share?
In this case, we will be taking a look at color, specifically the average color of all the pixels in a photo, in order to determine the characteristics of a photo that will increase engagement from viewers.
